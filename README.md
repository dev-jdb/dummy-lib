## Description

A simple template for creating a typescript library. This application was inspired by this [blog post](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/how-to-create-a-typescript-npm-library-for-dummies-6633f2506a17).

## Roadmap

Features I'd like to include in this template.

- [ ] Testing/coverage (jest?/vitest?/istanbul?)
- [ ] Generated docs (typedoc)
- [ ] Style enforcement (prettier/eslint/husky?/lint-staged?)
